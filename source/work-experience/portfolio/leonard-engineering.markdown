*August 2001 to March 2002*

The Leonard Engineering project involved creating a web site for the company. This included creating a design, implementing a web-based email form, and adding content.

I actually created two different designs for Leonard Engineering. The first design was fine and the client was happy, but I later decided to give another option by creating a second design. The second and final design was more colorful and visually appealing.

This site is still live at [LELLC.com](http://lellc.com), although I do not maintain the web site.
