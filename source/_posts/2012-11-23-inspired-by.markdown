I am finally moving back towards taking time to learn instead of always working. Somewhat ironically, I find myself being more productive and working on more projects, including this blog.

I want to thank my co-worker and friend, [The Weekend Programmer](http://theweekendprogrammer.com), for motivating me to work on some of my own projects and inspiring me to share what I learn along the way.

Currently I am working on learning and making use of [Zend Framework 2](http://zendframework.com) and ZF Commons to write version 3 of [Lightdatasys](http://lightdatasys.com). Since ZF2 is relatively new, documentation and experience is relatively sparse across the web. I'll do my best to try share my experiences as I go. If you know of a better or another way to do something, please do let me know!
